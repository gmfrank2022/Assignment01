// STEP 1
// STEP 2
// STEP 3

//1. Convert the following highlighted identifiers to Camel Case notation:
//let someMonth
//function theMonth()
//let currentMonth
//let summerMonth
//let mylibraryFunction

//2. Give me an example of a numeric literal expression, a string literal expression, a Boolean literal expression, and a null literal expression.
//4.55 //numeric literal expression
//'testtest' //string literal expression
//true //Boolean literal expression

//3. Give me two examples of complex / variable expressions.
//let someMonth = 'February'
//let currentMonth = 'January'

//4. Declare (but do not assign) 9 variables for the following identifiers: 
// First Name, Last Name, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Your Age, Referral Source, May We Contact You. 
// Use Camel Casing and Hungarian Notation when naming your identifiers.
//firstName, lastName, strAddress, strCity, strState, zipCode, yourAge, referralSource, strMayWeContactYou

//5. Take the 3 of the 9 variables that you created above and 
// demonstrate 3 ways for declaring and assigning values to those variables.
//let strAddress
//let strCity
//let zipCode

//let strAddress, strCity, zipCode

//const strAddress='asdfasd'
//const strCity='fda'
//const zipCode='12214'

//6. Create a variable.
//Add a number and a string and display the coerced result in the browser’s console window.
//let strFirst = 'This is the '
//let strSecond = 'nd month of the year.'
//let iMonth = 2
//let strConsole = strFirst + iMonth + strSecond
//console.log(strConsole)

//7. Create two variables.
//For the first variable, add a Boolean and a string and display the coerced result.
//For the second variable, add a number and a Boolean and display the coerced result. 
//let boolStr = true + ' Is it correct?'
//console.log(boolStr)

//let numBool = 3 + true
//console.log(numBool)

//8. Is the following string literal valid? If not, how would you fix it?
//let someString = 'Who once said, "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."'
//console.log(someString)
//correct it into the following:
//let someString = 'Who once said, \"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I\'m not sure about the former.\"'
//console.log(someString)

//9. Create a variable that produces a null value in the console window.
//Then, create a variable that produces an undefined value in the console window.
//let x=null
//console.log(x)
//let x
//console.log(x)

//10. Use the unary typeof operator on various literals to return the following types within the console window: 
// string, number, Boolean, object, and undefined.
//typeof 'afasd'
//typeof 12345
//typeof true
//let car=new Object()
//typeof car
//let x
//typeof x

//11. Within an alert box, use the concatenation operator (+) to display text in the alert box that appears as follows:
//alert('Hello '+'Frank Wu'+', welcome to the JavaScript class!')

//12. Declare a variable called name and set it equal to your name.
//Substitute your name in the previous alert string with the variable instead.
//let strName = 'Frank Wu'
//alert('Hello '+strName+', welcome to the JavaScript class!')

//13. Declare a variable called course and set it equal to “JavaScript”.
//Rework your alert string so that it displays the string of text 
// but using the variables as opposed to hard coded text.
//let strName = 'Frank Wu'
//let course = 'JavaScript'
//alert(`Hello ${strName}, welcome to the ${course} class!`)

//14. Rework the above string so that a line break is added right before the word “Welcome”. 
//let strName = 'Frank Wu'
//let course = 'JavaScript'
//alert(`Hello ${strName}.\nWelcome to the ${course} class!`)

//15. Replace the hardcoded string of your name with a prompt that asks the user for their name. 
// The prompt’s response will now be captured in the name variable.
//let strName = prompt('What\'s your name?')
//let course = 'JavaScript'
//alert(`Hello ${strName}.\nWelcome to the ${course} class!`)

//16. Replace the hardcoded string of the class you are taking with a prompt 
// that asks the user for the class they are taking. 
// The prompt’s response will now be captured in the course variable.
//let strName = prompt('What\'s your name?')
//let course = prompt('What\'s the course?')
//alert(`Hello ${strName}.\nWelcome to the ${course} class!`)

//17. Declare a variable called x and assign it a value of 10.
//Declare a variable called y and assign it a value of 20.
//Display the sum of those two numbers in the console window.
//let x = 10
//let y = 20
//console.log(x+y)

//18. Declare a variable called x and assign it a value of 20.
//Add and assign 20 to that variable and display the result in the console window.
//The result should be 40.
//let x = 20
//x += 20
//console.log(x)

//19. Declare a variable called x and assign it a value of 20.
//Multiply and assign 5 to that variable and display the result in the console window.
//The result should be 100.
//let x = 20
//x *= 5
//console.log(x)

//20. Declare a variable called x and assign it a value that equals the remainder of 20 divided by 3.
//Divide and assign 1 to that variable and display the result in the console window.
//The result should be 2. If you got 6.66 try again.
//let x = 20%3
//x /= 1
//console.log(x)

//21. Using a set of Comparison and Logical operators, 
// write an application that evaluates to true and displays the result within the console window.
//let x=55
//let y=66
//console.log(x == 55 && y == 66)

//22. Using a set of Comparison and Logical operators, 
// write an application that evaluates to false and displays the result within the console window. 
// The application cannot use the same operators used in the previous application.
//let x=66
//let y=55
//console.log(x == 55 || y == 66)
